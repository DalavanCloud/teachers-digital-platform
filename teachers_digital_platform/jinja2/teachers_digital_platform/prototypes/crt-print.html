        <h3>To save as a PDF:</h3>
        <p><strong>Windows users:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the print menu by pressing Ctrl+P.</li>
            <li>Under the "Printer" drop-down menu, select "Microsoft Print to PDF" or "Save as PDF." (The exact wording may vary by
                browser.)</li>
            <li>Click "Print."</li>
            <li>When prompted, choose where you want to save the file.</li>
            <li>If you're on an older version of Windows that does not have the built-in Microsoft Print to PDF printer, the Google
                Chrome browser provides its own "Save as PDF" option.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Mac users:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open the print menu by pressing Command+P.</li>
            <li>From the PDF drop-down menu (in the lower-left corner), choose "Save as PDF." (In Chrome you may be able to skip
                this step and select “Open PDF in Preview.”)</li>
            <li>When prompted, choose where you want to save the file.</li>
        </ul>
