            The ultimate goal of the work of BCFP is to help you improve your financial well-being. Financial well-being means how much your financial situation and money choices provide you with security and freedom of choice.

        <p>
            Developing financial capability during youth is an important stepping stone on the path to adult financial well-being. Financially capable individuals have healthy money habits, stick to plans, and apply their knowledge and skills to successfully complete financial tasks. These knowledge, skills, and behaviors of financial capability stem from three interconnected building blocks that develop over time and are marked by key milestones.

            The building blocks provide a framework for youth financial literacy education and help students learn the skills and knowledge they need to achieve financial well-being as adults. Children and youth need all three of the interconnected building blocks to achieve adult financial capability.
